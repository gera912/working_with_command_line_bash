This assignment uses the file ```wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens``` which you should already have on your computer. You can find it on Canvas if you do not.

This file was generated by MISO (Mixture of Isoforms). MISO “is a probabilistic framework that quantitates the expression level of alternatively spliced genes from RNA-Seq data, and identifies differentially regulated isoforms or exons across samples.” It compares the exon inclusion level between two different samples (one wild type mouse and one mouse with myotonic dystrophy [DM]). A table of column number and its contents is shown below.

Answer the following questions using the Unix commands learned in class. Each question can be answered with a single command (usually containing multiple parts). Report the answer and the command you used to achieve it.

1.	How many splicing events were examined in the file?
```
command: grep -c  "^chr"  wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens
output: 7327
```
2.	How many different genes were examined in this file (do not include genes missing their gene symbol in this count)?
```
command: cut -f 20 wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens|  grep 'ENS'| sort | uniq | sort | wc -l
Output: 3881

cat wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | cut -f 20 | grep –v “symb” | grep –v “n/a” | sort | uniq | wc –l
3881


```
3.	What are the names of the chromosomes in the file and how many splicing events were found on each chromosome?
```
command: cut -f15 wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | grep -v 'chrom'|  sort | uniq -c | sort | cat

4.	Which event has the highest positive difference between the conditions on chromosome 1?
(hints: use the -k option to sort in part of the command, type ctrl+v tab to type a literal tab character on the command line)

```
command:cut -f 1,8,15  wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | sort -k 2| grep '\t1$' | tail -n 1
output: chr1:171343438:171343563:-@chr1:171341013:171341123:-@chr1:171338008:171338637:-	0.69	1

cat wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | grep "    1       " | sort -k 8 -n | tail -1 | cut -f 1
chr1:171343438:171343563:-@chr1:171341013:171341123:-@chr1:171338008:171338637:-
```

5.	What is the highest Bayes factor in the dataset? How many events have this value?
```
command: cut -f 9 wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | sort -k1 -h| uniq -c | tail -n 1

Output: 74 1000000000000.00

cat wt_vs_DM1.miso_bf_ens | cut -f 9 | sort -n | uniq -c | tail -1
  74		1000000000000.00
```
