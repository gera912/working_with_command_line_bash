What do the following options do (use man command)?

```
-1 when using ls command: man ls
answer: list one file per line

-i when using rm command: man rm 
answer: prompt before every removal

-I when using rm command: man rm 
answer:prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

-r when using rm (WARNING! Be sure you know what you’re doing before running this command) command: man rm 
answer:remove directories and their contents recursively

-S when using less/ command: man less/ 
answer: --chop-long-lines Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (trun‐ cated) rather than wrapped. That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not shown. The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.

--number when using cat coomand: man cat --number 
answer: cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

```
